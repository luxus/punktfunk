//! Adaptive bitrate: AIMD controller for the Automatic bitrate setting.
//!
//! Runs in [`crate::client`]'s data-plane pump on the 750 ms cadence shared with
//! [`crate::quic::LossReport`]. FEC absorbs short random loss; this controller
//! asks the host for a different encoder rate via [`crate::quic::SetBitrate`]
//! when congestion persists.
//!
//! Severe windows (unrecoverable frame, flush, ≥6 % loss, deep decode or encode
//! rise, keyframe storm) back off ×0.7 immediately. Ordinary congestion needs
//! two consecutive bad windows. Recovery is slow start (double, bounded by
//! proven-throughput headroom) then additive (+~6 % after ~4.5 s). Each change
//! rebuilds the encoder (IDR); silence after [`MAX_UNACKED`] unanswered requests.
//!
//! Caps are learned: two identical short host acks latch `host_cap_kbps`; two
//! similar decode-driven backoffs latch `decode_cap_kbps`, and so does decode
//! headroom on a clean window (park at 80 % of the frame budget, retreat a
//! notch at 90 %, each step kept only if the decoder's latency follows the
//! rate). Both re-probe on [`CAP_REPROBE_WINDOWS_MIN`]. Climbs need
//! utilization (delivered ≈ target) and stay within ×1.5 of the proven mark.
//!
//! [`AbrMemory`] carries that mark and the congestion wall to the next session
//! on this host, so a thin link is not re-found. Tests pin the contract.
