//! Native audio plane: desktop capture → Opus (`AUDIO_MAGIC` / `AUDIO_RED_MAGIC`) or lossless
//! PCM (`AUDIO_PCM_MAGIC`) at the negotiated channel count. Opus is 48 kHz, 5 ms, constrained
//! VBR at [`AudioTier`](punktfunk_core::audio::AudioTier). PCM covers both rate families
//! (44.1/48/88.2/96/176.4 kHz), 16/24-bit, and a negotiated frame duration — see
//! `design/hi-res-audio.md`.
//!
//! The plane is chosen once at handshake and never switches: the client's output device is
//! open at a fixed rate. [`NativeAudioEnc`] and [`audio_thread`] compile on linux/windows
//! (libopus + a real capturer); other targets get the stub so a dev build streams video-only.
//! Unlike GameStream this path has no FEC, so it uses constrained VBR rather than hard CBR —
//! see [`NativeAudioEnc::new`].
