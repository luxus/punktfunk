//! PipeWire desktop-audio capture through a host-owned virtual sink.
//!
//! Default (`PUNKTFUNK_STREAM_SINK` unset): create a `support.null-audio-sink`
//! adapter and capture its monitor. That node is a **driver** (`timerfd` in the
//! daemon data loop), so the capture group owns its clock. A stream node is a
//! follower; PipeWire would schedule the group on any running driver on the box.
//!
//! `=stream`: the capture stream itself is the `Audio/Sink`. Same routing, but
//! the group borrows a driver. One-release escape hatch.
//!
//! `=0`: follow the default sink's monitor. Coupled to hardware-default churn.
//! Both sink modes advertise the session channel count, so a game can produce
//! 5.1/7.1 when local hardware is stereo.
//!
//! `!Send` MainLoop/Stream live on a dedicated thread; interleaved `f32` leaves
//! over a bounded channel (drop, never block the loop). Drop quits the loop
//! and tears the sink so a surround session can replace a stereo capturer
//! without leaking a consumer (a wedged link head-blocks the daemon).
