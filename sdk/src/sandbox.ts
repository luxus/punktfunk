// One sandbox per plugin (design/host-trust-boundaries.md §3.1).
//
// The runner is a `systemd --user` unit, so it shares the operator's uid — and a mount namespace
// alone is no boundary against the same uid: `/proc/<host pid>/root` reaches the files it hides,
// and `/proc/<pid>/environ` and `kill` pass the same check. What makes this one hold is the pid
// namespace: with `--unshare-pid` and a fresh `/proc`, the host's process does not exist inside,
// so there is nothing to reach through.
//
// Each plugin gets: an empty home, its own state dir, the paths its manifest declares, its own
// token, and a unix socket to the host. No network unless it declared one. Pin: `sandbox.test.ts`.
