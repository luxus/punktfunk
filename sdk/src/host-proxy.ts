// The way a sandboxed plugin reaches the host.
//
// A plugin runs with no network namespace of its own unless it asked for one, so it cannot dial
// the loopback management API. The supervisor listens on a unix socket bound into each sandbox and
// forwards what arrives to the host over the connection it already makes — the pinned TLS one.
//
// It forwards, it does not vouch: the plugin presents its OWN bearer, and a request without one is
// refused by the host exactly as it would be on loopback. Nothing here adds a credential.
