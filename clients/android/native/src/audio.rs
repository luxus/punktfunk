///    writes `num_frames * channels` of them, so a stream that came back with a different layout
///    or format is not merely mis-tuned — it is an out-of-bounds write on a realtime thread.
///    The NDK contract says an explicitly-requested value is honoured or the open fails, so this
///    should be unreachable; "should be unreachable" is not a licence to trust a HAL about the
///    length of a buffer we are about to write.
/// 2. **`request_start` fails.** The old code gave up on the spot rather than trying the next rung,
///    so one grumpy configuration disabled audio for the whole session.
/// 3. **The stream starts and never calls back.** Nothing detected this, and it is the failure that
///    matters most: the decode thread cheerfully decodes into a device that will never play it,
///    every counter looks plausible, and the only symptom is silence.
///
/// ⚠ **The rate check is compared against the RUNG, not a constant, and it is no longer only a
/// memory-safety check.** Every rung used to ask for 48 kHz, so `!= 48000` could only mean a HAL
/// misbehaving. Now the session negotiates its rate, so this comparison is also the §9 rule — *a
/// client that opens its device and gets a rate other than the resolved one must say so and fall
/// back, not resample quietly* — and rejecting the rung is how it says so. A rung that asked for
/// nothing (AAUDIO_UNSPECIFIED) is held to the SESSION's rate: it exists to rescue a HAL that
/// refuses explicit requests while already running at the rate we wanted, never to accept whatever
/// the HAL felt like.
