/**
 * The network speed test: measure the path to a host **over the real data plane** — connect, ask
 * the host to burst filler for two seconds, report goodput and loss, and offer to apply a
 * recommended bitrate in one tap.
 *
 * The measurement is the easy half. The half that was wrong everywhere for a long time is *where
 * the answer goes*: a measured bitrate belongs in the layer the tested host actually resolves
 * bitrate from (design/client-settings-profiles.md §5.3). Writing it to the global — the
 * long-standing behaviour — meant measuring the slow retro box downstairs quietly re-tuned the
 * desktop too. [SpeedTestTarget] is that decision, and because it depends only on the host it is
 * known *before* the result lands, so the button can say where it will write.
