 * Hardware keys ahead of Android's own shortcuts. The window policy takes Alt+Tab, every Meta
 * chord and the Language key before an app sees them; an accessibility service that filters keys
 * runs in the input dispatcher before that policy. The user turns it on under Accessibility.
 *
 * It hands every key to the focused stream ([stream], set by [MainActivity]) and consumes what the
 * stream owns. With no focused stream it touches nothing: other apps' keys pass straight through,
 * and it never reads window content — the config requests key filtering only.
