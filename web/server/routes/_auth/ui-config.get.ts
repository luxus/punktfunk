// the console (2026-08-05 review H-3), so the browser needs the port to build the iframe URL — and
// it must come from the server, because only the server knows whether that listener actually bound.
//
// Public (the `/_auth/` prefix is), which is fine: a port number is discoverable by connecting to
// it, and nothing here is a secret. Deliberately NOT an inference the client makes for itself
// (`location.port + 1` would silently point at whatever else is on that port).
