// POST /api/v1/native/pair/arm — arming a window mints the PIN that pairs a device, and a paired
// device injects keyboard and mouse on the host desktop. That is code execution by any other name,
// so it joins update/apply and the hooks write behind the console password (util/confirm.ts): a
// 7-day session cookie must not be enough to admit a new device.
//
// Wins over the `/api/**` catch-all by h3 route specificity. The PIN comes back in THIS response
// and nowhere else — the polled status has it stripped (../pair.get.ts), so reading it needs the
// password too.
