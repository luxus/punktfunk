// POST /api/v1/actions/{id} — invoking a host action (sleep/reboot/shutdown,
// design/host-actions.md) is password-gated like update/apply: a 7-day session cookie alone
// must not be able to power the machine off. The password is verified here (only the BFF knows
// it), stripped, and never forwarded — the upstream request body is EMPTY by design (the id is
// the whole request; no field reaches the host's privileged path).
//
// This specific file wins over the `[...]` catch-all (h3 route specificity), which is what
// keeps the catch-all from proxying the invoke UNgated.
