 *
 * The counter has to survive a restart or it does not do its job: an in-memory `let epoch = 1`
 * revokes within one process run, then resets to 1 the next time the service starts, and a cookie
 * captured from that first run is accepted again for the rest of its TTL. (The seal key cannot save
 * us — it is derived from the stable mgmt token, so pre-restart cookies still unseal fine.) So it
 * lives in a file next to the host's own config.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: if the file cannot be read or written the console still works, it just
 * falls back to in-memory revocation for this process. Refusing to log anyone out because a state
 * file is unwritable would be the wrong trade for a LAN console.
