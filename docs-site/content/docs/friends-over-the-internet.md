title: Friends over the internet
description: Let a friend stream from your host without putting them on your home network — Porthole for PC friends, Tailscale sharing for everything else, and what not to use.
---

A friend wants to join your host for the evening — a second controller, a time limit, nothing
else — and they are not on your LAN. Inviting them into your Tailscale network works, but it hands
them every machine and service on it. This page gets them to Punktfunk on one host and nothing else.

Punktfunk already does the hard part. Nothing streams without [pairing](/docs/pairing), you set
what a device may do and for how long ([Access levels](/docs/access-levels)), and video is
encrypted per session. All you need to solve is how the friend reaches the host.

## Pick a path

| Your friend streams from | Use |
|---|---|
| A PC, Mac or Steam Deck with Steam | [Porthole](#porthole) — easiest, nothing to configure on your router |
| A phone, tablet, Apple TV, or no Steam | [Tailscale machine sharing](#tailscale) |
| Anything, and you manage your own router | [Port forwarding](#port-forwarding) — not recommended, and the only path that exposes the host to the internet |

Every path needs the video port pinned first.

## Pin the video port

The video plane normally picks a random UDP port per session. A tunnel or a rule has to name one,
so pin it in `~/.config/punktfunk/host.env` (Windows: `%ProgramData%\punktfunk\host.env`) and
restart the host:

```ini
PUNKTFUNK_DATA_PORT=9779
```

Any free UDP port works. Avoid 9778, which the browser client's WebTransport plane uses.

## Porthole

[Porthole](https://porthole.sestudio.org/) is a free Steam app that shares ports you pick with
Steam friends. It works behind any router, and the friend sees only the ports you share.

1. Both of you install Porthole from Steam.
2. You create a lobby and share UDP `9777` and `9779`, without remapping. Add TCP `47990` if the
   friend should browse your game library.
3. The friend joins with your share code or from the friends list, accepts the ports, and adds
   `127.0.0.1:9777` as a host in their Punktfunk client.
4. [Admit them as a guest](#admit-them-as-a-guest).

One Porthole friend at a time: the pinned port serves a single session.

## Tailscale

Tailscale can share one machine with someone outside your network. They see that machine only.
Your access rules still decide what they may reach on it, and the default rule lets them reach
everything — that is the step people skip.

1. In the [admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines), open the host's **⋯** menu
   → **Share** and send the invite. Any free Tailscale account can accept it; the friend installs
   Tailscale on the device they stream from (every Punktfunk client platform except LG webOS).
2. In [access controls](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls), replace the default `"src": ["*"]`
   rule — `*` includes shared users — with one rule for members and one for shared users, using
   the host's Tailscale IP:

   ```jsonc
   "acls": [
     { "action": "accept", "src": ["autogroup:member"], "dst": ["*:*"] },
     { "action": "accept", "src": ["autogroup:shared"], "dst": ["100.x.y.z:9777,9779"] }
   ]
   ```

   Add `47990` only if the friend should browse your game library.
3. The friend adds `100.x.y.z:9777` as a host, or opens a
   [link](/docs/presets-and-links#punktfunk-links) you send them: `punktfunk://connect/100.x.y.z:9777`.
4. [Admit them as a guest](#admit-them-as-a-guest).

## Admit them as a guest

The friend's first connect shows up on your console as a pending device. Admit it with a
[PIN](/docs/pairing#pair-with-a-pin), not a bare Approve — read the PIN out over voice chat — and
pick **Controller only**
([choosing access](/docs/pairing#choosing-access-when-you-admit-a-device)).

For the expiry, **Until they disconnect** fits an evening: a minute after their last session ends
the record is gone, so nothing is left to clean up and coming back means knocking again. The
minute is deliberate — a router blip should not cost them a re-pair — and they can reconnect
freely inside it. A clock-time expiry works too, and refuses the device once it passes. **Expire
now** or **Unpair** on the Paired devices table ends a running session at once.

## Port forwarding

**Not recommended. Prefer [Porthole](#porthole) or [Tailscale](#tailscale) whenever either one
reaches your friend** — both leave the host unreachable from the internet, and this does not. Take
this path only when neither fits, and take the rules below seriously.

Forward UDP `9777` and `9779` to the host. **Never forward `47990`, `47992` or `9778`** — the
management API, the web console and the browser plane.

Send a [link](/docs/presets-and-links), not a bare address, so your friend's first connect is
verified rather than blind. The **Connect** card on the Host page writes one; swap its address for
your public one:

```
punktfunk://connect/<id>?host=203.0.113.5&fp=<64 hex>
```

Strangers knock once the port is open. Nothing streams to them: an unpaired device is refused, the
host tags the knock **From the internet**, and such a knock is admitted only through a PIN window
named for its own fingerprint — the row's **Arm PIN** does that, and its access starts at
Controller · until they disconnect. A window you opened for your own next device never answers
one, and neither refusal spends the PIN.

Read the PIN out over voice chat. There is no Approve button on that row on purpose: the name a
pending device shows is one it chose for itself, and from the internet that is all it is.

A pairing that keeps being refused usually means a stranger is knocking into the same rate limit.
Wait a moment and retry.

## Voice chat while they play

If you talk on Discord on the host while friends stream in, the default audio setup gives one of
two wrong results: the host's speakers stay silent because the stream owns the output, or, with
**Keep host audio playing** on a client, everyone hears everything — the friends' own voices
included, a beat late. That is routing, not echo: Discord's playback is inside the captured mix.

Two lines in `host.env` on a Linux host give the shape you want — you and the friends hear the
game, the friends never hear themselves:

```ini
PUNKTFUNK_AUDIO_OUTPUT_MODE=host_and_client
PUNKTFUNK_AUDIO_VOICE_CHAT=host
```

The first plays the stream's sound on the host's speakers too. The second keeps Discord, Vesktop,
WebCord, ArmCord, Legcord, TeamSpeak and Mumble on those speakers and out of the stream; for
Discord in a browser tab add the browser with `PUNKTFUNK_AUDIO_VOICE_APPS=discord,firefox`.
Restart the host after editing `host.env`. If one friend should not hear the game at all, the
console's **Session** card mutes a single session.

## What not to use

ZeroTier, Hamachi and Radmin VPN work, but they expose every port on the host to the friend, not
just Punktfunk's. playit.gg, ngrok and Cloudflare Tunnel cannot carry a video stream.
