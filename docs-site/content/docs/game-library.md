title: Your game library
description: How Punktfunk finds your installed games, how to add one by hand, and how to launch a title from a client, from Moonlight, or from the command line.
---

A Punktfunk host keeps one **game library** that every surface reads from. It has two sources: the
[plugins](/docs/plugins) you install for the launchers you use, and entries you add by hand in the
[web console](/docs/web-console).

Whatever its source, a title looks the same everywhere: a poster, a name, and a stable id like
`steam:570` or `custom:9f2a1c…`. Pick one on a client and the host launches it into the stream.

## Where your games come from

**Install a plugin for each launcher you want in the library.** A fresh host holds no games until
you do — on the console's **Library** page, open **Game sources** and install the ones you use, a
click each.

Each plugin reads that launcher's **own local files** on the host — no accounts to connect, no API
keys, nothing leaves the machine to build the list. A launcher that isn't installed contributes
nothing, so an unneeded plugin costs you an empty source and nothing else.

| Plugin | Linux host | Windows host | What it reads |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Steam** | ✅ | ✅ | Installed titles from `appmanifest_<appid>.acf` in every Steam library folder, plus your own **non-Steam shortcuts** |
| **Lutris** | ✅ | — | The local Lutris database (`pga.db`) |
| **Heroic (Epic / GOG / Amazon)** | ✅ | — | Heroic Games Launcher's local library cache, all three of its backends |
| **Epic Games Launcher** | — | ✅ | The launcher's install manifests |
| **GOG** | — | ✅ | The GOG install registry and each game's `.info` file |
| **Playnite** | — | ✅ | Your Playnite library, whichever stores it aggregates |
| **Ubisoft Connect** | — | ✅ | The launcher's install registry |
| **Amazon Games** | — | ✅ | The app's `GameInstallInfo.sqlite` database |
| **Battle.net** | — | ✅ | The agent's `product.db` |
| **Desktop entries** | ✅ | — | `.desktop` files in the Game category, Flatpak exports included |
| **Bottles** | ✅ | — | Each Bottle's `bottle.yml` program list |
| **itch.io** | ✅ | ✅ | The itch app's `butler.db` |
| **ROM Manager** | ✅ | ✅ | Your ROM folders, matched against a metadata source |

Deliberately left out: Steam's tooling — Proton, the Steam Linux Runtimes, Steamworks Common
Redistributables, SteamVR — so your grid holds games rather than plumbing, and any non-Steam
shortcut you have hidden inside Steam.

[`punktfunk-host library`](/docs/host-cli), run on the host, prints the whole library as JSON —
"does the host see my games?" without involving a client.

## Turning a source off

On the console's **Library** page, the **Game sources** card shows one chip per source this host
has; a highlighted chip is contributing titles, and clicking it turns the source off.

That hides its titles **everywhere at once** — the console grid, every native client, the Moonlight
app list, and launching — with nothing deleted and no restart: the plugin keeps its titles, and
turning the source back on brings them straight back on the next read. (To remove a source's titles
for good, uninstall its plugin.)

Hand-added entries are not a source and have no chip — they are always shown.

The choice is stored per host in `library-scanners.json`, next to the rest of the host config
(`~/.config/punktfunk/` on Linux, `%ProgramData%\punktfunk\` on Windows). Only the sources you turned
*off* are written down, so a source added later starts enabled.

## Adding a game by hand

Anything your launchers don't know about — an emulator, a ROM, a DRM-free build, a tool you want on
the couch — goes in by hand: on the console's **Library** page, click **Add custom game**.

**Title** is the only required field. **Launch command** is what the host runs for this title; leave
it empty and the entry is a poster with nothing to launch.

Under **Details (optional)** a title can carry:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Platform | The system it runs on — `PS2`, `Xbox 360`, `SNES`, `PC`. Scanned titles are all stamped `PC` |
| Description | A short blurb |
| Developer / Publisher | Free text |
| Release year | Shown next to the title on the poster tile |
| Players | Maximum local players |
| Region | `NTSC-U`, `PAL`, `NTSC-J` |
| Genres | Comma-separated |
| Tags | Comma-separated labels of your own — `co-op`, `kids`, `finished` |

Every field is optional and free-form; the host doesn't normalize the values. A poster tile shows the
platform badge only when it isn't `PC`, since that would be true of everything scanned.

Manual entries live in `library.json` in the host config directory. That file drives commands the host
runs, so it is locked down to the host user (0600 on Linux, a SYSTEM+Administrators ACL on Windows) —
treat what you type there as operator-level configuration.

> **Editing replaces the whole entry.** The console form re-sends every field it knows about, so
> nothing you can see is lost — but fields the form has no input for (prep/undo steps in particular)
> are **cleared** when you save through the form.

### Cover art

The form takes four artwork URLs: **Portrait art URL** (the 2:3 poster, best for a grid), **Hero**,
**Header** and **Logo**. The console grid falls back from portrait to header, and to a plain text tile
when a title has neither.

Use a full `http://` or `https://` URL. A Windows-style absolute path (`C:\art\cover.jpg`) or a UNC
path also works: the host reads the file itself and serves the bytes to clients, so a path only the
host can see is fine. A plain Linux path like `/home/me/cover.jpg` is **not** recognized this way.

Either way the cover reaches a client from the host, not from the internet. The first client to open
the shelf makes the host download each `http(s)` cover once; it keeps the bytes under
`~/.cache/punktfunk/art` and serves them to every client from then on — including while the site they
came from is unreachable. Nothing is downloaded on a schedule or during a scan: a request for the
cover is the only trigger. A cover the host will not take — a redirect, something over 16 MB, or a
file that is not an image — stays the original URL for the client to fetch itself, as before.
`punktfunk-host library art --clear` empties the store; the next visit fills it again.

Scanned titles need no art of yours: a [plugin](/docs/plugins) publishes each title's cover while it
scans, and the host serves that the same way.

## Games from a plugin

A [plugin](/docs/plugins) can own a slice of the library and keep it in sync — this is how the ROM
Manager and Playnite plugins get your collection into the grid, box art and all.

A library plugin can also publish a **launcher tile** — an entry that opens Steam Big Picture,
Heroic's console mode, Lutris, Playnite Fullscreen, the Epic Games Launcher, GOG Galaxy or the Xbox
app itself rather than a game, so you can install or fix something from the couch. Where a launcher has both a couch UI and an ordinary window, they
are separate tiles: Steam Big Picture beside the Steam client, Heroic Console Mode beside the Heroic
window. Clients group them all into their own row above your titles, each drawing its launcher's
logo. A launcher tile you don't want is a switch in that plugin's settings.

Entries a plugin owns are read-only to you. The host refuses a hand edit or delete of one, because
the next sync would overwrite it anyway — change the title at its source and let the plugin sync
again. Only the plugin can remove its own entries, and it removes every one of them at once. Your
hand-added entries are never touched by a sync.

The console grid can't tell you which entries those are: a plugin's titles carry the same **Custom**
badge as your own and still show **Edit** and **Delete** on hover — the form and the delete
confirmation open as usual, but the host refuses the change and the entry stays as it was.

## Launching a game

Whatever the surface, the client sends only an **id**. The host looks it up in its own library and
runs what it already knows about the title, so a client can never hand the host a command to run.

Every library leads with a **Desktop** tile that streams the host itself and launches nothing — so
a host with no plugins installed is still one press from its desk, and getting there is not a trip
back through the host's menu. It reads **Resume <title>** when the host already has a game up,
which is also the only way back into one the host started on its own. On the Apple app's Library the
**Desktops** section holds one per paired host.

- **Native clients** — a **paired** host's card offers **Browse library…** (**Browse Library…** on
  Apple) with nothing to switch on first; pairing is the only condition, on every client. Pick a
  title and the stream starts with the host launching it. On iPhone and iPad the library is its own
  **Library** tab, and on the Mac the **Library** row in the window's sidebar, where the title menu
  picks the host. There a long press or right-click on a title offers **Play** (or **Resume**),
  **Favorites**, **Details…** and **Copy Link**.
- **Android** — the library lives only in the controller-optimized home, which a TV always uses and a
  phone or tablet switches to when a controller is connected. Press **Y** on a saved host, or press
  **up** for its options and choose **Library** — the route a TV remote takes, having no **Y** to
  press.
- **Steam Deck (Decky)** — the panel is a launcher and browses nothing itself: tap **Open
  Punktfunk**, which opens the client's console home, where a paired host's **Library** button is —
  full-screen covers, gamepad-navigable, and a press starts the stream with the title launching. See
  [Steam Deck](/docs/steam-deck).
- **Moonlight** — when the host runs GameStream compat (opt-in: `PUNKTFUNK_GAMESTREAM=1` in
  `host.env`, or `serve --gamestream` — see [Moonlight](/docs/moonlight)), your library appears in
  Moonlight's app list beside `Desktop`, with covers served by the host. A title keeps the same app id
  across host restarts, so Moonlight's cached tiles stay correct. Titles with no launch recipe are
  left out.
- **A link** — a [`punktfunk://` link](/docs/presets-and-links) carries the id in a `launch=`
  parameter, so a desktop shortcut, a browser bookmark or a home-automation rule starts the stream
  with the title already launching: `punktfunk://connect/couch-pc?launch=steam:570`. On the Apple
  apps, `punktfunk://browse/couch-pc` opens the library itself instead — that route backs their
  home-screen library widget and the **Open Game Library** shortcut, so a tap lands you in a
  picked host's library with nothing streaming yet.
- **The command line** — the client's own [`punktfunk`](/docs/host-cli#punktfunk-on-the-client-machine)
  command, which ships with the Linux and Windows clients. `punktfunk library <host-ref>` prints `id`,
  `store` and `title` as tab-separated lines, then a count (`--json` for tools);
  `punktfunk launch <host-ref> --game <id>` starts a stream that launches the title. A `<host-ref>` is
  a saved host's name, id or address, and both commands need it paired.

```bash
punktfunk library couch-pc
punktfunk launch couch-pc --game steam:570
```

How the game is actually started differs by host:

- **Linux** runs the resolved command — `steam steam://rungameid/…`, `lutris lutris:rungameid/…`,
  `heroic://launch…`, or your own command line. A title with no runnable command can't be launched
  from a client at all.
- **Windows** starts the title in the interactive desktop session once capture is up, using the
  right mechanism per store: Steam's `steam://` URI, Epic's launcher URI, the GOG game's executable,
  an Xbox game's package activation, or the command you typed on a hand-added entry.

Where the game *lands* — your live desktop, an existing gamescope session, or a dedicated headless
one — is display policy, covered in
[Dedicated game sessions](/docs/virtual-displays#dedicated-game-sessions).

## Play stats

Every launch stamps the title with a last-played time and adds one to its launch count. While the
launched game is seen running, its play time grows, and the same clock keeps the most recent run
on its own. Clients get the four numbers on each library entry; a title never launched from
Punktfunk carries none.

The Apple app sorts by them, **Recent** and **Most played**, names the number under each poster in
those sorts, keeps a **Recently Played** row on its Library, and shows all of it on a title's
**Details…**.

Play time is time the host can see the game: from the game running to its exit, while a session
is attached to it. A game kept running after its session ends is not counted until a client comes
back for it. A launcher tile, or a title the host cannot recognize as a process, keeps a
last-played time and launch count but no play time.

The numbers live in `library-stats.json`, next to `library-scanners.json`. Delete a title's line
to reset it.

## When a game or the session ends

The host tracks the game it launched, so quitting the game can end the session and stopping the
session can close the game. Both switches live on the console's **Virtual displays** page — see
[When a game ends, and when a session does](/docs/virtual-displays#when-a-game-ends-and-when-a-session-does).

## Prep and undo steps for one title

A custom entry can carry `prep` steps that run before it launches and undo steps that run when the
session ends — an HDR toggle, an audio-sink switch, a VRR tweak. They are documented with the rest of
the automation surface in [Events & hooks](/docs/automation#per-app-prepundo). The same file
carries `on_window.workspace`, which opens the title on an empty workspace of its own on Hyprland and
sway — [A launch on its own workspace](/docs/automation#a-launch-on-its-own-workspace).
