description: From nothing to streaming in five steps — install a host, open its console, pair a client, play.

Five steps, each linking to the detail only if you need it. Punktfunk is built for a **trusted home
network** — keep the host on your LAN or a VPN, never open it to the internet
([why](/docs/security)).

## 1. Install the host

On the PC you want to stream *from*, follow the one-page guide for its system — each one is the
install command, the group to join, and nothing else:

| Linux | Windows |
|---|---|
| [Ubuntu](/docs/ubuntu) · [Debian](/docs/debian) · [Fedora](/docs/fedora) · [Arch / CachyOS](/docs/arch) · [Omarchy](/docs/omarchy) · [Bazzite](/docs/bazzite) · [SteamOS](/docs/steamos-host) · [NixOS](/docs/nixos) | [Windows 11](/docs/windows-host) |

Not sure your machine qualifies? [Requirements](/docs/requirements) is the checklist.

## 2. Start it

- **Windows and SteamOS:** nothing to do — the installer started the host and the web console, and
  they come back on every boot.
- **Linux packages:** from a terminal inside your desktop session, start the host and the console
  once; they restart at every login from then on:

  ```sh
  systemctl --user enable --now punktfunk-host punktfunk-web
  ```

  On Arch install `punktfunk-web` first (your install page says how). Running a firewall? Your
  install page has the one line that opens it.

The host announces itself on your network, so clients find it by name. It works out which desktop you
run by itself — there is nothing to configure for a first stream.

## 3. Open the web console

The console is where you admit new devices. Open **`https://<host-ip>:47992`** in a browser (the
certificate is the host's own, so your browser warns once — continue) and log in:

- **Linux:** the password was generated on first start — print it with
  `sed -n 's/^PUNKTFUNK_UI_PASSWORD=//p' ~/.config/punktfunk/web-password`
  (SteamOS: the install script printed it; it's in `~/.config/punktfunk/web.env`).
- **Windows:** the wizard showed it on its last page. Installed with winget, or silently? There was
  no wizard, so print it from an **elevated** PowerShell with `punktfunk-host web password`.

Print it before you sign in: the console stores a salted hash from then on, and a forgotten
password is reset rather than read.

Lost it? [Reset it](/docs/forgot-password). Everything else about the console:
[The Web Console](/docs/web-console).

## 4. Install a client and pair it

On the device you want to stream *to*, install the app — [Install a Client](/docs/install-client)
has the link for every device (Mac, iPhone/iPad/Apple TV, Linux, Windows, Android, Steam Deck), and
any Moonlight client works too once you [turn GameStream on](/docs/moonlight).

Open the app: your host is already in the list.

Select it and **connect**, then click **Approve**
next to the device in the console's **Pairing** page — no PIN to type. (Prefer a PIN? **Pair a device**
shows a 4-digit code to type into the client.) Pairing happens once; the device reconnects on its
own from then on. Details: [Pairing & Trust](/docs/pairing).

## 5. Stream

Select the host, start streaming. The host creates a display at your device's exact resolution and
refresh rate; mouse, keyboard and controllers flow back. On a desktop client the stream takes your
mouse and keyboard — **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q** (⌃⌥⇧Q on a Mac) hands them back.

The next launch opens on the host list. Now that one host is paired,
[Start in](/docs/client-settings#behavior) can send it straight to that host's games, or into the
stream.

## Now that it works

- Launch installed games straight into the stream — [Game library](/docs/game-library) (install the
  [plugin](/docs/plugins) for each launcher you use).
- Tune resolution, bitrate, codec and HDR per device — [Client settings](/docs/client-settings).
- Copy here, paste there — [Shared clipboard](/docs/clipboard). Wake a sleeping host —
  [Wake-on-LAN](/docs/wake-on-lan).
- Run the host headless, with nobody logged in — [Running as a service](/docs/running-as-a-service).
- Already running Sunshine or Apollo? [Switching from Sunshine](/docs/switching-from-sunshine).
- Stuck? [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting) starts from the symptom.
